          <h3 class='subtitles'>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            After discovering my appreciation of physical geography at A-Levels, I completed a 3 year degree in geology at the university of Birmingham. I learnt scientific methods of analysing tectonic and seismic data, as well as using R language to identify trends in climate change predictions. My experience coding in my course led me to a realisation that I had a far greater vision in a more innovative and modern role, leading me to take the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through this I evolved a great understanding of how combining programming and my creative mindset can lead to better problem solving and developing abilities. I want to explore the possibilities of a career that combines the creativity of application design to the analytical skills I gained during my university degree to take a role that aims to create an accommodating and coherent experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a result, I have emphasised a dedication to a visibly-easing and efficient interface in my work, and I am looking to use my abilities in an ambitious workplace to begin my journey in software engineering. I’d like to take developmental skills I have learnt and apply them to a role with a larger scope of encouraging change towards a workplace of greater efficiency and receptiveness to improvement.

            <h3>Battleships</h3>
            <p>I created a working version of Battleships using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Centered around if-statement control flow, I tackled using logic to present an efficient turn-based system with effective results. I also experimented without randomisation to create a responsive computer-controlled opponent.</p>

            <h3>Yu-Gi-Oh TCG Price Index</h3>
            <p>
              My partner and I used a free API of the Yu-Gi-Oh TCG database from the internet to display a range of information to create a page for browsing different cards and their individual prices. 
              <br />
              <br />
              This involved developing skills in acquiring data from different objects and data structures from within the API. I personally built the different API requests and the displaying of the information retrieved. We worked together to use application storage and re-formatting API requests to create a ‘wishlist’ system for the user to keep track of specified items.

            <h3>Museum Mapper</h3>
            <p>
              As a group of 4, we created an app for browsing the range of natural history museums and exhibits across England. Together we used Mongo-DB and React to develop our own back-end API, seeded with 30 different museums each with their own details such as image, description, collections, and location for creating an interactive satellite map view. 
              <br />
              <br /> 
              I created the index ‘Show All’ page which displayed all of the museums in a concise card-view, using API requests and Bulma to style, as well as creating different integrated components for adding reviews and ratings through API ‘post’ requests and displaying them in a clear manner after re-rendering.

            <h3>Record-ID</h3>
            <p>
              For my final project, I decided to go solo to give myself a challenging experience in a time-sensitive scenario. Using a Django/Python back-end and a React front-end, I designed an app for browsing a database of music records, as well as giving the user the ability to add their own to be displayed in the index and on their own profile.
